# Evaluation 4 - Application Bank account

This is a work for my training, the interest is to test my skills on MVC architecture and oriented object programming.

In the basic version, we can:
* Create a bank account (Current Account, Livret A, PEL, Joint Account)
* Delete a bank account
* Credit or debit an account
* Transfer money from one account to another

I finished the basic version and I started the complicated version:
* We can't debit or transfer money from PEL account
* If If the balance of an account is <= 0, then the balance appears in red
